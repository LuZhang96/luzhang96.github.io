## What Keyboard are you using?
Last summer, when I did my summer internship in a German Company, I used a week to adapted myself to the German keyboard. Basically, we have different languages and input sources, keyboards could be different for local use. I have a collegue from Columbia, whos keyboard is different from the one we usually use. I thought it is a spanish one, but he told me it is Dvorak Keyboad. 

## Dvorak Keyboard 
Dvorak Keyboard is a shuffle version of QWERTY Keyboard which is based on the frequency of the letters we used in the most words. So that we do not have to move our fingers too often.
